00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,919
Question, what is polymerization?

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:05,240
Hey everyone and welcome.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,560
Today we're tackling a fascinating question.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,320
What exactly is 20-30 polymerization?

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,679
It might sound like a complicated term,

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,240
but the basic idea is quite simple.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,960
So let's break it down together.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,480
Polymerization is a chemical process

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,080
in which many small molecules, which we call monomers,

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,480
combine to form a much larger molecule known as a polymer.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,199
Think of it like building with Legos,

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,199
each individual brick is a monomer.

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,880
And when you connect them all together,

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,399
you create a larger, more complex structure,

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,359
which would be the polymer.

16
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,479
Now there are different ways this process can occur.

17
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,640
And we can broadly categorize them into two main types.

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,480
Addition and condensation polymerization.

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,719
Addition polymerization involves monomers

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,399
simply joining together without producing any byproducts,

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,960
kind of like snapping Legos directly onto each other.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,920
On the other hand, condensation polymerization

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,719
involves the elimination of small molecules,

24
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,039
such as water or hydrogen chloride during the reaction.

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,480
A great example of polymerization in action

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,599
is when it the molecules polymerized to form polythene,

27
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,879
which is a very common type of plastic

28
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,760
that you probably interact with every day.

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,840
Essentially polymerization is all about linking

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,680
simple units into long repeating chains.

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,480
And this allows us to create materials

32
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,120
with incredibly varied and useful properties

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,439
from plastics and fibers to resins polymerization,

34
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,880
plays a vital role in creating so many of the materials

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,320
we use in our lives.

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,840
And pretty amazing, right?
